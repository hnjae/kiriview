# KiriView

KiriView is a desktop image viewer built with KDE Kirigami.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All documentation, code, and artwork in this repository were vibe coded.

## Supported Image Formats

KiriView aims to display modern and uncommon image variants that are commonly
poorly supported by desktop image viewers. This includes AVIF images with alpha
channels, animated PNG (APNG) images, and HEIF still images or image sequences
that store JPEG, JPEG 2000, AVC/H.264, HEVC/H.265, or VVC/H.266 image data.

## Supported Archives

KiriView supports comic book archive containers with `.cbz`, `.cbr`, `.cb7`,
and `.cbt` extensions. Archive decoding is delegated to archive libraries
provided by the application runtime or package: ZIP, 7Z, and TAR containers are
handled through KDE KArchive, while RAR containers are handled through
libarchive. In the Flatpak build, these libraries are supplied by the Flatpak
runtime. KiriView does not implement archive format parsers itself, so archive
compatibility, unsupported variants, encryption behavior, and error handling are
bounded by the capabilities and limitations of those libraries.

As of May 2026, this has been verified with libarchive 3.8.5 in the current
Flatpak SDK and libarchive 3.8.6 in the Nix/devenv environment: RAR4 solid
archives are not supported by libarchive.

## Install the Current Development Version

These instructions install the current source checkout as a local Flatpak
development build. This is not a stable release build.

1. Install `flatpak` and `flatpak-builder`.
1. Add Flathub if it is not already configured:

   ```sh
   flatpak --user remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
   ```

1. Build and install KiriView into your user Flatpak installation:

   ```sh
   flatpak-builder \
       --user \
       --install \
       --install-deps-from=flathub \
       --ccache \
       --keep-build-dirs \
       --disable-tests \
       --force-clean build-dir \
       io.github.hnjae.KiriView.json
   ```

1. Run the installed development build:

   ```sh
   flatpak run io.github.hnjae.KiriView
   ```

To update the installed development build after changing or pulling the source,
rerun the build and install command above.

To remove the local development build:

```sh
flatpak --user uninstall io.github.hnjae.KiriView
```

## Flatpak Packaging Notes

The Flatpak manifest intentionally builds libheif as an application module instead of relying on the Freedesktop or KDE runtime copy. The runtime libheif and codec plugins have historically lagged the HEIF still-image and image sequence support KiriView needs, including JPEG, JPEG 2000, AVC/H.264, HEVC/H.265, and VVC/H.266 HEIF variants.

When updating the Flatpak runtime, SDK, SDK extensions, or codec plugin assumptions, re-check whether the bundled libheif module is still required before removing or changing it. At minimum, verify the current runtime libheif version, HEIF sequence decoding, alpha handling, and `just build-with-tests`.
